# SpotifyMusicFile

Reading information of 175.000 spotify songs and formatting it accordingly. Data was collected from the spotify api.

There are a lot of code snippets in here that are specifically written to meet what was asked in the activity.

Due to Github's file's size policy, I had to add the spotify's music data information as a zip file, you can still get the .csv file by unzipping it.
